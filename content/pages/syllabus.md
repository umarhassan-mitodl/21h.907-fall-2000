Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Overview
--------

This course focuses on famous political trials in history. It examines issues of evidence, interpretation, law, and society. Some questions we will ask include: What role does the trial play in public discourse? How does it crystallize certain political and social issues of the moment? How does the trial operate as drama? Are there certain conventions of trials which have emerged over time? How do legal reasoning and literary narrative or storytelling interact in these trials? What conflicts emerge in the trials between individuals and the state, the church and the state, actors in public and private arenas? How do trials contribute to (and detract) from public discourse? What role does changing technology play in trials?

Assignments
-----------

All students will be responsible for each week's reading and will write a weekly response paper of 2-3 pages. Students will also each co-lead one class, providing questions for discussion on that day.

There will be one final paper (15-20 pp.) which will be due on lecture 11. As part of writing your final paper, the following due dates will also apply: statement of paper topic, lecture 3; initial bibliography, lecture 4; annotated bibliography, lecture 6.

Grading

Grading will be as follows: response papers and class discussion - 40%, leading one discussion - 10%; final paper - 50%.
